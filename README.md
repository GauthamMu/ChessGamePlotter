## Chess Game Plotter

Hello and welcome to my chess game plotter!

It's a chess game plotter. To plot moves. In a chess game. Not complete yet, will finish soon (hopefully)

If you notice any errors or scope for improvement, let me know, either with the Issues function on GitHub or personally!

## Features

‚òê Plotting out a complete chess game on a board (I'm working on it, okay?)

## Installation

There are no dependencies, yet. So, all you have to do is get the ChessGamePlotter.py file!

## Running the app

If you installed Python on your machine, you should know how to run a Python script.

## Usage

You can't use the app that much, as I only implemented pawn and knight moves, but if you want to use the existing functionality, just follow the program's advice.

### Customisation

Not implemented yet, I'll do that though.

## Project Structure

```
ChessGamePlotter.py
```

### Key Components

- `ChessGamePlotter.py`- The app. Did I mention that you have to run it in the terminal?

## Performance Considerations

It's a python fle running in the terminal. That should be enough.

## License

No. You can fork it if you want though.

## Future plans

- Finish the program
